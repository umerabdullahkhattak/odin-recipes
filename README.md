Hi, 
    In this project I'll build a  Recipes website which would contain a main page and links to other pages. The pages would contain the name of the dish followed by the recipe of that dish.
After completing this project, I would have demonstrated following skills:
1. Headings in HTML
2. Lists in HTML
3. Links in HTML
4. To add, commit and push files into a git repository from command line.
